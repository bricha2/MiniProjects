python run.py 
 -- This will print the resulting list of coordinates found
 -- It calls train.py, which returns parameters that are given to test.py's function which returns the foundList

All packages used are part of the basic Anaconda installation.

If you want to change the training data, change the train_data line found at the top of the train.py file. 
   Keep the train_data variable the same though.

If you want to change the testing data, change the test_data line found at the top of the test.py file.
   Keep the test_data variable the same though.

If you want to change the subset of the train image us, change the range of i and j in the embedded for loop in test.py

Thanks!
