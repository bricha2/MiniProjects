Change the arguments in runProgram.py to fit your SQL server. Change username and password before attempting to run.

To run programs, load MySQL on command line (this differs for different installations):

mysql -u username -p jupyter < loadAll.sql

If this doesn't work, open loadAll.sql (and other sql files as well) on Sql Workbench and run through.

If the username and password are changed in the runProgram.py file, it should run as a python file.
